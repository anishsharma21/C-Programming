# C-Programming

Worked my way up from digital logic -> microarchitecture -> ISA/Assembly programming

Now, moving up to the next layer of abstraction with C programming.

I will be learning C through exercises and small projects, and pairing my learning of the language with Operating Systems and Systems Programming theory/projects.
